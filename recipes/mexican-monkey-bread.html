    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I made this last night, and WOW it was delicious. I actually made it for a breakfast dish one time, and I think it's perfect for that as well.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 (16.3 ounce) package refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough, separated and each portion cut into quarters</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>¾ cup jalapeno pepper slices, divided</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon dried parsley flakes, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Pour melted butter into a small bowl. Dip each piece of biscuit dough in melted butter to coat.</li>
      <li>Arrange enough of the biscuit dough pieces in the bottom of the loaf pan to form a single layer; top with 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup pepper slices, and 1/4 teaspoon parsley. Repeat layering once and top with remaining biscuit dough pieces, pepper slices, and parsley flakes.</li>
      <li>Mix remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese together in a bowl; spread over the top of the ingredients to cover.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool bread in pan for 5 minutes before inverting onto a plate to serve.</li>
